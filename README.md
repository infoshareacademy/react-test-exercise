# React Test - JavaScript excercise

## Display users and their details using remote API

Using JavaScript display list of 10 random users (name and image/avatar).
On selecting user from the list display its details.

## Form

Display form - up to you. Its minor for this excercise. We want to check yours JavaScript skills, not styling.
Libraries you'll use - up to you. But try to be kind and use `fetch` to retreive data :)

## Data

Use https://randomuser.me/ to retrive data.
