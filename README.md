# React Test — JavaScript exercise

## Display users and their details using remote API

Using JavaScript display list of 10 random users (name and image/avatar).
On selecting user from the list display its details.

## Form

Display form — up to you. It's minor for this exercise. We want to check yours JavaScript skills, not styling. Libraries you'll use - up to you. But try to be kind and use fetch to retrieve data :)

## Data

Use https://randomuser.me/ to retrieve data.
